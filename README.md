# habitmap
A simple commit-tracker-esque habit tracking website, made to motivate one about a goal! Having a visual form of feedback about consistancy has been the trick for me physically lately, so I decided to implement a website version to help others!

This habit tracking tool features (or will feature):

- Persistant habit-tracking
- Accurate month lengths
- Streak tracking tool
- Degree of completion indication
- Customizable color scheme and detailed CSS

Enjoy, and if you have any questions please contact me! Happy tracking!
