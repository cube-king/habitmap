# habitmap
A simple commit-tracker-esque habit tracking website, made to motivate one about a goal! Having a visual form of feedback about consistancy has been the trick for me physically lately, so I decided to implement a website version to help others!
I've always been fascinated with productivity and consistancy as a lifestyle, and this will surely help me - in fact, I've already used this quite a bit!

This habit tracking tool features (or will feature):

- Persistant habit-tracking
- Accurate month lengths
- Degree of completion indication

And in future updates:

- Streak tools
- Customizable themes and CSS

Enjoy, and if you have any questions please contact me! Happy tracking!
